Read in all processes into list or dictionary then pop when process time = current time. 

Need to get the full layout of the algorithm first before doing anything else.

Until 10/14:
    Get familiar with code.
    Think about round robin technique



Future
    scheduler will be selected in the program arguments. 



Logic and Rules to rememeber:
    bursts are processed incremently not the overall process itself
    scheduler can finish a burst and assign a burst in the same clock tick
    process can only be moved to cpu from the ready queue
    process can only be moved to IO from wait queue
    processes cannot have back to back IO bursts
    processes can have back to back CPU bursts
