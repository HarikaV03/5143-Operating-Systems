## Overview

In this project, we will implement a basic "shell". A shell is a command-line interface we often interact with, and provides an powerful interface with your system. Below is an overview of the actions our shell will perform:

1. Print a prompt(`$: `) to the user.
2. Read a command line from stdin.
3. Tokenize (lexically analyze) the command a create an array of command parts (tokens).
4. Parse the token array to identify the command and its arguments.
5. Execute the command:
    - If necessary, create a child process via `fork()`.
    - The child process receives an additional input (arguments) and executes the appropriate command.

## Requirements

- **Language**: Python
- **Threads (Optional)**:
    - Use threads to execute commands.
    - If no background execution (`&`), wait for the thread to complete before returning control to the shell.
- **Command Features**:
    - Each command returns a string.
    - Commands can accept input from other commands.

Our shell will support the following command types:

### 1. **Exit Command**

- **Command**: `exit`
- **Description**: Terminates the shell.
- **Concepts**: Exiting the shell with system calls like exit().

### 2. **Command without Arguments**

- **Example**: `ls`
- **Description**: Executes a command without arguments and waits for it to complete.
- **Concepts**: Synchronous execution, process forking.

### 3. **Command with Arguments**

- **Example**: `ls -l`
- **Description**: Parses command-line arguments and executes the command.
- **Concepts**: Command-line paramaters.

### 4. **Background Execution (`&`)**

- **Example** `ls &`
- **Description**: Executes a command without blocking, allowing the shell to accept further input immediately.
- **Concepts**: Background execution, signals, asynchronous execution.

### 5. **Output Redirection**

- **Example**: `ls > output.txt`
- **Description**: Redirects the command output to a specified file.
- **Concepts**: File operations, output redirection.

### 6. **Input Redirection**

- **Example**: `sort < inputfile.txt`
- **Description**: Takes input from a file instead of the userâ€™s input.
- **Concepts**: File operations, input redirection.

### 7. **Piping Commands**

- **Example**: `ls -l | more`
- **Description**: Passes the output of one command as input to another command.
- **Concepts**: Pipes, synchronous operations.
